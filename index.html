<p>Everything <br> You Need to Know<br> About The New School Commencement 2017 <br><span>by Taylor Kugler </span><span>March 15, 2017</span></p>

<div class="content"> 

<p><span class="firstLetter">F</span><span class="sentence">or the first time in the past 16 years, The New School’s university-wide commencement ceremony will take place outside of its home borough of Manhattan.</span></p> 


<p>The graduation ceremony for the class of 2017 is slated to be held at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/USTA+Billie+Jean+King+National+Tennis+Center/@40.7503676,-73.8456118,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xb0118df7792c6346?sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwixgILkt8_SAhXCQSYKHQyXAsgQ_BIIdDAK" target="_blank">United States Tennis Association Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens.</a> For some seniors at the New School the venue is a welcomed change. For others, the change has brought only questions and frustration. With little information provided by the school about the change here is everything a 2017 New School grad needs to know. </p>

<p>One issue for students about the change in venue is the distance. “Holding the commencement ceremony in a venue in Queens is pretty inconvenient, seeing as it is pretty far away from the university itself,” said Eugene Lang senior Shaha Al-Khamees. 
</p>

<p>The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is located roughly 40 minutes to an hour from The New School’s Union Square Campus. Students can get to the venue by car or public transportation. For those who are planning on taking the subway, you can take the 7 Train from Grand Central Station to Mets Willets-Point Station. For those who plan on using Uber, a fare estimate from the University Center to the venue for UberX is between $38-$48. </p>

<p>According to the university the distance “was considered, but we were very limited in our options and didn't have many choices, due to the large amount of people we need to accommodate,” said Michelle Relyea, Vice President of Student Success. “The larger venues are in the outer boroughs.”
</p>

<p>While the event is farther away from campus than past venues, not every senior lives on, or even near campus. “This is such a large commuter school that Queens is probably closer to some people than school is,” said Odalis Garcia a senior at Eugene Lang. </p>

<p>The event will also take place at an earlier time than in the past, starting at 11:30 a.m on Friday May 19th. Keep in mind that graduates are expected to arrive between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m, so don’t forget to set your alarms. </p>

<p>Students also feel that previous venues have felt more prestigious, and are representative of New York City. “I remember before they held the ceremony in Madison Square Garden, which is a staple of NYC and it clearly represents the New School,” said Al-Khamees. </p>

<p>The university-wide ceremony has previously taken place at historic New York City venues such as Radio City Music Hall, Madison Square Garden, and most recently at the Jacob K. Javits Center. </p>
<p>“I was disappointed that we weren't be having our commencement at Javits,” said Eugene Lang senior Nicole Coiscou. “It is such a historic and awe-inspiring place, one I dreamed about walking through, and it was just taken away from us.”</p>

<p>Availability and capacity are two of the biggest factors taken into account when selecting a venue according to the university.</p>

<p>"Javits [Center] is not currently available as it is about to undergo major renovations,” said Michelle Relyea, Vice President of Student Success. “We looked at a number of locations throughout NYC; however, there are very few options that accommodate our size and those that are (such as MSG) are not willing to commit due to sport teams and potential playoffs.”</p>

<p>For colleges located in Manhattan the number of options for commencement venues within the borough are slim. With no large college stadiums, or venue spaces on most campuses, universities are left duking it out for some of the few large-enough locations. The current choice in venue of Arthur Ashe Stadium holds over 23,000 people, while Radio City Music Hall has a capacity of 6,000. At Madison Square Garden the capacity varies by area and set up, but falls between 19,800 for the basketball arena and 5,600 for the Theater.</p>

<p>“The New School has this image about being a NYC school -- well, NYC isn't only Manhattan,” said Garcia.</p>

<p>One of the most well-known colleges in Manhattan, NYU, also holds their university-wide ceremony outside of Manhattan at Yankee Stadium. They have been doing so since 2008, after holding their previous ceremonies inside Washington Square Park. </p>

<p>“I think that it’s far, but it’s an iconic place and a venue that can actually hold everyone,” said NYU senior Eduardo Olmos the venue. </p>

<p>For NYU’s smaller ceremonies for colleges including Tisch and the College of Arts and Sciences ceremonies are held at Radio City Music Hall. Other colleges within the university, including The Stern School of Business, are held at Madison Square Garden. </p>

<p>Radio City Music Hall is a popular venue amongst Manhattan Colleges. Both Hunter College and Barnard will be holding their ceremonies there. Other universities located uptown including Columbia and The City College of New York will be holding their ceremonies on their respective campuses. </p>

<p>Two other Manhattan colleges, The Fashion Institute of Technology and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice will also be holding their commencement ceremonies at the Arthur Ashe Stadium for the first time this year. Previously F.I.T.’s was held at the Jacob K. Javits Center, while John Jay’s was at Madison Square Garden. </p>

<p>As a school with little interaction with sports, other students were left wondering why the university would choose a tennis court for the commencement ceremony.“I feel like a tennis field barely represents the university,” says Al Khamees. </p>

<p>Parsons student Lina Aquino shares this sentiment. “Javits center is so beautiful and I don't know how graduating in a tennis venue makes any sense for an art school.”</p>

<p>While there isn’t much of a connection between sports and The New School, the location, and the those who the venue are named after, do hold similar values to the university.</p>

<p>The venue is located inside Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, which was the site of the 1964 World’s Fair.</p> 

<p>“At the time we were looking at venues, it really was about practicality,” said  Relyea, “however, learning more about the space and the proximity to Flushing Meadow-Corona park… we realized the Fair was hailed as  'universal and international' with the theme of 'peace through understanding' and that does resonant with who we are at The New School.”</p>



<p>The USTA Billie Jean King Tennis Center is perhaps most well-known as the home of the U.S. Open, and has been the venue of choice for the tournament since 1978. There are over 20 courts located inside the center, and additional courts in the adjoining park.</p> 

<p>Formally known as the USTA Tennis Center, it was renamed in 2006 to honor tennis legend Billie Jean King. King is a former World No.1 tennis player, and a 39-time champion title holder. She has also been a pioneer for the LGBT community, and was one of the first openly gay female athletes. King was also a pioneer for equal pay among women in the sport. She helped formed the Women’s Tennis Associated in 1973, and threatened to boycott the 1973 U.S. Open until pay equality was addressed. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.active.com/tennis/articles/billie-jean-king-using-sports-for-social-change" target="_blank">"I wanted to use sports for social change,"</a> said King. King later received the Presidential Medal in 2009 for her activism.</p>

<p>The New School’s ceremony will be located at the Arthur Ashe Stadium, one of three stadiums on the property. The stadium is the largest tennis-only venue in the world. The stadium is named after another tennis player and social pioneer, Arthur Ashe. Ashe was the first, and only African American man to ever win the singles tournament at Wimbledon, and the US Open. He achieved a number of firsts in the tennis community, including being the first African American man to hold the rank of No.1 tennis player in the world. After contracting HIV from a blood transfusion, Ashe went on to use his status to raise awareness and educate the public about the virus.</p>

<p>In addition to being named after social activists, the stadium has also undergone a recent renovation. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Since 2013 the USTA center and the Arthur Ashe Stadiums have been under going a <a href="http://www.si.com/tennis/beyond-baseline/2013/08/15/usta-retractable-roof-over-arthur-ashe-stadium" target="_blank">$550 million renovation.</a> While not all of the renovations are complete, those inside the Ashe stadium are. Renovations have included the installation of a new retractable roof within the Arthur Ashe stadium, a new 14,000 seat Louis Armstrong stadium and the addition of new courts. So not matter rain or shine everything will run smoothly at the 2017 commencement.</p>

<p>While the venue may not be perfect, at least we’re graduating! </p>

<p>Here are some spots near the venue to check out after graduation! </p>
